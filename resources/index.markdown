###Resources

This is just a big dumping ground for all the tools etc I use in case anyone is interested. One day I might go and create walkthroughs for setting up the individual dev environments, but there are a ton of tutorials out there for all this stuff already(how do you think I set it up in the first place?) so its not super high on my TODO list.

####Development

#####Blog

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) For gists and hosting via GitHub Pages
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) This what GitHub Pages runs on and its been pretty sweet so far
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) This is what I currenlty use to write all the Markdown/html/css although I'm starting to experiment with some more specialised markdown tools that offer a preview
- [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

<br/>

#####Android

- [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) This comes with the SDK so is all you need.
