[WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/) is one of my favourite productivity and organisational tools. I use it for a bunch of things: braindumping, planning my day, planning meetings, fleshing out blog posts(like this one), task tracking, a kanban calendar(stolen from [Productiviy Mashup](http://www.productivitymashup.com/blog/2014/8/17/kanban-calendar-workflowy)), basically you name it, you can get workflowy to do it. It is not a hugely complex tool; it is actually very simple, however it is deceptively powerful.

####What does it do?

WorkFlowy is simple enough, it is primarily a notetaking app. In its most basic form it lets you quickly and easily write down bullet points and then nest, reorganise, tag and search them. Simple right?

####So where does the power come from?

The power is in the last part of what I mentioned above: reorganise, tag and search. Clicking and dragging lets you move a note. Tab/Shift + Tab lets you nest/unnest note. Writing `#MyTag` will automatically make a tag, same with `@MyTag`(incidentally I use `#` tags for a subject, and `@` tags for people). Clicking a tag will take you instantly to a filtered view of all your notes that have that tag. The search box lets you search through all your notes for any word or partial word as well as tags.

####So how is this useful?

WorkFlowy lets me quickly and intuitively braindump a ton of information about a topic, then quickly and easily organise it into a meaningful structure and index what I have written against other things I have written in the past. I can take notes in a meeting and then go back over them and quickly an efficiently organise the items into categories and tasks and even tag the ones that involve people so I can convert them to tasks or follow ups for the people involved. I have tried a bunch of other notetaking apps(OneNote, Evernote, Wunderlist), however none of them have been as easy to use or as intuitive(for me at least). This kind of productivity tooling is always going to be a somewhat personal choice, WorkFlowy is the one that works for me and despite trying others, I have found none of them as simple or easy to use and let me get into a "flow" as I'm writing.

Oh, and I nearly forgot workflowy lets you export and share your notes in either formatted, plain text or OPML and even create links to sections of your notes to allow people view or edit them live.

Its also totally free to use(up to 500 notes per month). The paid version comes with some really nice additions(themes, backup to dropbox, password protection for shared notes, etc) which is why I have a paid account(plus it is really affordable and I like supporting software that I find so useful). If you need more reasons to upgrade you can read someone else's reasoning [here](http://blog.workflowy.com/2013/12/05/why-i-went-pro/).
