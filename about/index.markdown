#### Short Bio:

I have been a developer since I think around 2004(good god, over 11 years :S). I have worked on pretty much everything at one time or another: aerospace inventory management, real estate software(for pocket pc!), a [AAA cross platform game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashes_Cricket_2009), 3D projection, a car sales website, virtual credit cards and currently an android app with backing webservices. I have spent most of my time working with C# but have deployed to production in anger in Java, C/C++, CLI/C++(the terror), Groovy and of course HTML and Javascript.

I created this site as a place to post hopefully useful stuff I have learned and some stuff that might be useful to other people and maybe the odd opinion piece about development.

If you really want to contact me I guess you can try and talk to me on twitter: [@RexRonin](https://twitter.com/RexRonin). No guarantee of a reply but feel free to try.

#### What's with the stoopid name?

Sit down for a while lad and I will spin you a tale of an impoverished student drinking too many beers... When I was an impoverished student living in Brisbane I got into playing a few Snes ROMs. One day after playing [Chrono Trigger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger) for probably far too long, I came across this gem [Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Ronan:_Experimental_Surgeon) then, probably because I had had a few too many light beers for my own good, I went on to missspell the name when I was going to use it as a gamertag. It has been my go to gamertag for a while now and when I created my github account I decided to use it and now here we are. You have now filled your brain up with a *completely* useless piece of information about why my blog has a dumb name and I got to write all these words for fun. I hope this story replaced calculus cos that will be super easy to re-learn.
