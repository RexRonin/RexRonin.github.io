I also get the weird impression that some Android devs have developed something akin to [Stockholm Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) when working with the Framework. I keep seeing Stack Overflow posts where someone raises an issue with the framework then the accepted answer is what on any other platform or in any other code base would be at best a terrrible hack explaining that this is just "the way" to do this particular thing in the framework. This kind of thing is not "the way" this is an acceptance of a bad framework and that a system coded to be tightly coupled and needlessly complex(and therefore most likely full of sublte bugs and hard to change) is acceptable. I wonder if this is the reason so many Android applications are buggy and crash(not to mention parts of the OS at times).
