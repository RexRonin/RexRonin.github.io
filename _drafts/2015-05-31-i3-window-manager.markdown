title: i3 Tiling Window Manager
tags: productivity linux development
---

So since starting my new role I have moved from using Windows as my OS to [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.github.io/). Part of this change has been using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as my window manager.

To be honest, before I moved to Linux I didn't even know such a thing as a Window Manager existed as a concept. Now I shudder everytime I boot back into Windows and hit Alt-Tab.

###What ARE you talking about?

To me, i3 is the biggest thing since moving from DOS to Windows. That *may* be a slight overstatement, however for me it has been an absolute reveleation in how I work and how productive I feel I can be.
Bear in mind I have lived in Windows land for pretty much entire professional development career and while I have dabbled with other OSes I have always been constrained to running on the Micrsoft stack so haven't had the luxury of seriously trying anything else.

###Explaing yourself!!!

So. Alt-Tab is cool(or the 3-finger swipe or whatever on your mac), but imagine instead that you could actually cut those "screens" up into smaller pieces and have applications nested inside the parents... As an example, I have the current tab on laptop screen divided into 2 sections: half the screen is showing Sublime Text in which I am writing the markdown for this blog post, the other half has a chromium window open to Workflowy showing my skeleton/notes for this post. I'm not endless Alt-Tabbing back and forth, or switching to my cursor to switch focus, I can keep my hands on the keyboard and control everything as well as letting me see both windows clearly.
Once I add my lovely big [Asus WQHD screen](http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=558_1213&products_id=30765) things get even better. When developing our website I have the main screen divided into 2 showing a screen of code and the site I'm working on, with my laptop screen usually showing a mock of the page/workflow I'm currently building on one half with the other half split vertically into 2 bash windows so I can monitor the output of the app I'm working on. This is probably better explained in a diagram:

I also usually have a couple of other tabs setup with things like my comms apps(gmail, skype, slack), another with Robomongo and another bash window, then another tab with 2 panels of chromium with Workflowy then jira/asana/lucidchart/invision/google sheets open for reference or for doing Product Management work.

###The best part

Configuration. You can configure pretty much anything. On top of this, you can control the entire machine from the keyboard once you learn the shortcuts, no more switching to the mouse/trackpad when navigating around your open windows, its crazy.
When I as you can configure anything, I mean it, I spent nearly a day just playing with the config, changing commands, what the status panel at the bottom of the screen displays and when, the display output setup and related shortcuts, its great(btw, you don't have to do this, I just couldn't help myself once I realised how much control I had)
I'll write another post soonish with an explanation of my setup and my complete config if anyone is interested.

###Finally

For me this switch has been nothing but productivity++. YMMV if you aren't a developer, but tbh I think it would work for anyone as fundamentally it allows you to make much better use of whatever screen realestate you have available.
