The worst part about all this as well is that the Android framework isn't new anymore(v1.0 [came out in 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history)). There has been 6 years to fix these issues. Fragments didn't even exist before Honeycomb and that is probably the thing that grates on me the most. That the Android framework dev team chose to release Fragments in their current state when they in theory didn't have any real time pressure and could have done this properly. Which means this is just bad design and implementation OR the fundamental structure of the framework is bad and instead of fixing it or releasing a version which steps away from the legacy issues they decided to keep it. Either one does not reflect particularly well on the team behind it(for not raising these issues and proposing a proper solutin) or the decision making from a higher level(ie. whoever manages them overruling the actual fix and forcing the release of a sub-standard product). 

It saddens me to think that a company I thought would have some of the best developers in the industry consists merely of the mediocre developers I see running around supporting crashing and buggy websites and wondering why I get so angry about base classes and bad inheritance patterns.
